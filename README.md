# SOME ZOO APP THIS IS

Context does not seem to be working on page reload for some reason I can't explain.
Still working on a fix for the moment.
Will update on this later.

## Available Scripts

You know the drill.

### `npm i`

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back! So simply DON'T!**
